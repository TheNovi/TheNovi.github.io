				<h2>Who am I?</h2><br>
				I am just 20 years old programmer and gamer from Czech Republic.<br>
				If you want to know more (for some reason). <a href="Contact.html">contact me</a>.

				<h2>Programming</h2>
				I wrote my first "Hello world!" program at the <a href="https://www.spsejecna.cz/english">high school</a>. It was in C# window application.<br>
				That was the time when I got an idea for a small assistant, but Google was quicker. Also that year I tried making my first game for LudumDare.<br>
				The second year of school we were learning Java. And that year my friend told me about Python. Next year I started my Music Player (see <a href="Projects.html">Projects</a>).<br>
				After finishing high school, I managed to get at <a href="https://fit.cvut.cz/en">CVUT FIT</a>. But only for a very short time, because I started to hate C, don't understand integrals. So I quit.<br>
				Get a job in a near Hotel, and started learning programming myself.

				<h2>Gaming</h2>
				Everything started when I got PlayStation 2 on my 5-7th birthday (don't remember exactly). There I got hooked on my favorite game "Jak and Daxter" which was funny because I didn't know any English (it didn't change much since then ).<br>
				After some time (I think it was on my 10th birthday) I got PlayStation 3, ahh great times.<br>
				But the most important moment was my 15th birthday when I got my first notebook and new age started. Also, that was the time I started going to high school where my programming lives started.<br>
				Since then I have played hundreds of games, just switching them, never really got hooked to any of them.<br>
				When I was 20, I got my new awesome desktop computer and here we are.<br>
				Right now I am mostly playing <a target="_blank" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/">osu!</a>.<br>
				One thing is for sure if the game is top played/streamed game, I don't play it. It's not like I hate it because it's popular or anything. I just don't enjoy (idk why). I always more liked 2nd/3rd tier games.
