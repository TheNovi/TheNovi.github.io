        <h2>Programming</h2>
        I wrote my first 'Hello world!' program at the
        <a href='https://www.spsejecna.cz/english' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>high school</a>. It was a C# window application. Later that year I tried making my first game for LudumDare.<br>
        The second year of school we were learning Java. And that year my friend told me about Python. Next year I started my Music Player (see
        <a href='Projects.html'>Projects</a>).<br>
        After finishing high school, I managed to get at
        <a href='https://fit.cvut.cz/en' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>CVUT FIT</a>. But only for a very short time, because I started to hate C and didn't understand higher mathematics. So I quit.<br>
        Got a job in a near Hotel, and started learning programming myself.

        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        Everything started when I got a PlayStation 2 for my 5-7th birthday (don't remember exactly). There I got hooked on a game named 'Jak and Daxter' which was funny because I didn't know any English.<br>
        After some time (I think it was a gift for my 10th birthday) I got a PlayStation 3, great times.<br>
        But the most important moment was my 15th birthday when I got my first notebook and new age started. Also, that was the time I started going to high school where my programming lives started.<br>
        Since then I have played hundreds of games, just switching them, never really got hooked on to any of them.<br>
        When I was 20, I got my new awesome desktop computer and here we are.
